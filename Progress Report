Coding is coming along together nicely, but has yet to be 100% completed and tested.


goals of the project:
is that the coding works with some steady prescion to measure the period (or frequency) of a timing circuit. 
the output of the circut is flowing in a continuous cycle without any random breaks in the circuit.

resources contracted: 
we are using this website (https://www.electronicdesign.com/resources/ideas-for-design/article/21144327/microcontroller-efficiently-measures-frequency-and-period) to help us establish what our timing apparatus and mathematics need.

some initial results: as the coding and apparatus has yet to be used together, the initial results are none.
