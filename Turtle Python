This is a paragraph describing what I intended the turtle to do in this program. 
I intended for the turtle to start with creating a triangle in black in the center of the page, 
then move to a pentagon in red in the upper left corner without a line connecting the two, 
then move to an octagon in blue by the lower right-hand corner, then move to the bottom left-hand corner create a green square. 
For kicks and giggles, I also added a green circle near the center of the page under the triangle 
to make sure I had the correct amount of shapes needed as the octagon was hard to see on the page because 
of how far away I placed it. All of this is to be done within a python turtle program.
