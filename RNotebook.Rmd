This project was created by Caitlin Mertz and Lauren Brese.
Caitlin Mertz contributed to the team by finding reasources to implement the coding and by creating the github repository that the group was able to work through.
The project began with a Raspberry Pi computer, 5 led bulbs of assorted colors, 5 short connecting cords, 6 long connecting cords, a circuit board, and 5 [metal thingys]. The Raspberry Pi was connected to a monitor and booted up. Then the circuit board was connected to the Raspberry Pi by attaching the [long black] cord to stabalize the electrical charge. The 5 led bulbs were then placed 5 spaces apart from each other at spaces 60, 55, 50, 45, and 40. After being placed, the short wires and [metal thingys] were used to connect the electrical currents to the light bulbs. After setiing up the circuit board the coding began. ---
